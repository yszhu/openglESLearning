A better way to store vertex data used in 
vertex shader is using buffer object ,
in this way ,data of vertex attribute will
stored in GPU instant of memery ,so there is
no need to transport them every time when draw frame

in the demo VertexBufferObject ,it seems that 
shader will check buffer object first when get data of
vertex attribute and the default source is vertex buffer object.
cause both array way and vertex buffer object way
 transport data to vertex shader use the function
glVertexAttribPointer ,the difference between them is the last 
param, array way is the data buffer(from data array),
and vertex buffer object way is offset of the first vertex data.
for more detail,checking java code.
